## What's inside this repository?

This repository contains some documents explaining how to export from and check the PDF files to print on [http://lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com) print on demand service, using InDesign.
 
For now this repository contains 3 different documents (PDF):
 1. How to set up Lulu 'job options'
 2. How to export the PDF for Lulu
 3. How to check the PDF you've made to be sure it doesn't contain errors

The repository can still be augmented in the future with new 'How to' documents.
